## Course Overview

My goal, in creating the course, is to take the general, *language-agnostic* data science concepts you've learned in (e.g.) DSAN 5000 and work through how to **implement** these concepts **efficiently** in Python, where we can define "efficient" in different ways based on different **goals** that we may have in different settings while working as Data Scientists.

The graded components for the course consist of **five** homework assignments, an in-class **midterm**, and a **final project**. Grades will be allocated as follows:

| Assignment | Percent of Final Grade |
| - | - |
| **HW1**: Python Fundamentals | 8% |
| **HW2**: Data Structures | 8% |
| **HW3**: Basic Algorithms | 8% |
| In-Class **Midterm** | 30% |
| **HW4**: Advanced Algorithms | 8% |
| **HW5**: Algorithms | 8% |
| **Final Project** | 30% |

The course does not have any "official" prerequisites, but a general comfort with **Python** is strongly recommended. If you have never used Python before, however (or if you haven't used it in a while and feel like your skills are rusty), you can browse the materials on the <a href='./resources.html' target='_blank'>Resources page</a>, to help make sure that everyone is on the same page coming into class in the Spring!

## Course Topics / Calendar

The following is a rough map of what we will work through together throughout the semester; given that **everyone learns at a different pace**, my aim is to leave us with a good amount of **flexibility** in terms of how much time we spend on each topic: if I find that it takes me longer than a week to convey a certain topic in sufficient depth, for example, then I view it as a strength rather than a weakness of the course that we can then rearrange the calendar below by adding an extra week on that particular topic! Similarly, if it seems like I am spending too much time on a topic, to the point that students seem bored or impatient to move onto the next topic, we can move a topic intended for the next week to the current week!

## Official Course Description

The Data Structures, Objects, and Algorithms in Python course will look at built-in data structures, such as dictionaries, lists, tuples, sets, strings, and frozen sets. The course will also cover objects and classes in Python, as well as building new structures and objects. The class will cover algorithms including runtime, recurrence, and development. Applications will include data science problems. *Prerequisite: A working or intermediate knowledge of Python. 3 credits.*
