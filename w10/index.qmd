# Prefect Lab Part 2 {data-name="Prefect Lab"}

* [Week 9-10 Lab: Pipeline Orchestration with Prefect](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1hwBQcam-fGordWAvyEnbyK412CR1CQAV?usp=sharing' target='_blank)

## HW4: Final Pieces of the Data-Pipelines Puzzle {data-stack-name="Serial Pipelines"}

* Overview (Quotes to Scrape)
* Web Scraping with BeautifulSoup
* Python's `Counter` class
* RRule.js

## Data Mining

![](images/gambling.jpg){fig-align="center"}

## Quotes to Scrape

* Created by Zyte as a <a href='http://quotes.toscrape.com/random' target='_blank'>"sandbox"</a> for web scraping
* Has "levels" representing more and more difficult scraping tasks: <a href='https://toscrape.com/' target='_blank'>ToScrape.com</a>
* Our case: Not **harder** than the "main" site, just a different task to simulate a different environment
* Could take the HW3 pipeline and "plug in" **Twitter**, **stock data**, etc.

## First Pipeline: One Quote Per Second {.title-09}

* **E**xtract: Scrape the quote data from the webpage's HTML
* **T**ransform: Filter out **function** words, compute **frequencies** for **content** words
* **L**oad: Save the 
* Our copilot: **Pydantic!**
  * Use a `Quote` class, extending `BaseModel`, to specify data fields and ensure quality/uniformity
* Run once per second, 10 times total

## Second Pipeline: Post-Scrape Report

* First pipeline has successfully run 10 times... what now?
* Answer: Generate a **report** for your boss up at the entrance to the quote mine
* **E**xtract: The ten scraped `Quote` objects
* **T**ransform: Find top 5 words, top 5 tags, and generate a wordcloud
* **L**oad: Embed the words, tags, and wordcloud within a **Markdown document** that gets emailed to your boss

## BeautifulSoup

* Without giving away the answers...
* The key to this part is to **inspect the source** of the Quotes to Scrape page, and identify the **HTML tags** and **classes** containing each piece of info you need to extract!

## RRules

* A **language** for specying **schedules** for tasks
* In the same way that we can run SQL queries from within Python, we can use RRule syntax to specify **schedules** for tasks from within Python
* <a href='https://jkbrzt.github.io/rrule/' target='_blank'>RRule.js Demo</a>

## Python's `Counter` Class

* A fancy wrapper around a plain-old `dict`!
* (Quick Colab demo to see how it works: **creating** a `Counter`, **combining** two `Counter`s)

# Serial Pipelines $\rightarrow$ Parallel Pipelines {data-stack-name="Parallel Pipelines"}

* Don't worry; for now, just a high-level overview of what we'll dive into in the final unit

## Quick Survey Question, for Intuition-Building

* Are humans capable of **"true" multi-tasking**?
  * As in, doing two things at the **exact same time?**
* (Or, do we instead **rapidly switch back and forth** between tasks?)

## The Answer {.smaller .crunch-title .crunch-ul}

* (From what we understand, at the moment, by way of studies in neuroscience/cognitive science/etc...)
* Humans are **not** capable of true multitasking! In CS terms, this would be called **multiprocessing** (more on this later)
* We **are** capable, however, of various modes of **concurrency**!

| | Multithreading | Asynchronous Execution |
| - | - | - |
| **Unconsciously**<br>(you do it already, "naturally") | Focus on **one** speaker within a loud room, with tons of other conversations entering your ears | Put something in oven, set alarm, go do something else, take out of oven once alarm goes off |
| **Consciously**<br>(you can do it with effort/practice) | Pat head (up and down) and rub stomach (circular motion) "simultaneously" | Throw a ball in the air, clap 3 times, catch ball |

## Helpful *Specifically* for Programming

* One <a href='https://book.sciml.ai/' target='_blank'>famous book</a> phrases it like: if implemented thoughtfully, concurrency is a **power multiplier** for your code (do 10 things in 1 second instead of 10 seconds...)

![](images/mario.gif){fig-align="center"}

## Helpful *In General* as a Way of Thinking! {.crunch-title .crunch-ul .title-09}

* Say you get hired as a Project Manager...
* Part of your job will fundamentally involve **pipelines!**
  * Need to know when Task $B$ does/does not require Task $A$ as a prerequisite
  * Need to know whether Task $A$ and Task $B$ can **share one resource** or **need their own individual resources**
  * Once Task $A$ and $B$ both complete, how do we **merge** their results together?

## Avoiding the Rabbithole

* Parallel computing is a **rabbithole**, but one you can safely avoid via simple heuristics ("rules of thumb")!

1. Check for optimizations to serial code first,
2. Check for **embarrassingly parallel** code blocks
3. Use **map-reduce** approach for more complicated cases

## "Embarrassingly Parallel" Pipelines {.smaller .crunch-title .crunch-ul}

* Technical definition: tasks within pipeline can easily be parallelized bc **no dependence** and **no need for communication** (see next slide). Better video explanation:

## Parallelizing Non-Embarrassingly-Parallel Pipelines... {.smaller .title-10}

![epic_bacon_lifehack.jpeg](images/epic_bacon_lifehack.jpeg){fig-align="center"}

## Buzzkill: Complications to Come 😰 {.crunch-title .crunch-ul}

* If it's such a magical powerup, shouldn't we just **parallelize everything**? Answer: No 😞 because **overhead**.
* Overhead source 1: Beyond "embarrassingly parallel" cases, threads may require **their own separate stacks and heaps**
* Overhead source 2: Even after setting up new stacks and heaps, threads may need to **communicate with one another** (especially if they need to **synchronize** at some point(s))
* In fact, probably the earliest super-popular parallelization library was created to handle **Source 2**, not Source 1: <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Passing_Interface' target='_blank'>**Message Passing Interface**</a> (C, C++, and Fortran)

## The Worst Part, IMO {.smaller}

* Plenty of problems in CS/data science have these kinds of complications... (if they weren't complicated, we wouldn't have as many jobs)
* We saw for example, with **hash tables**, how we can try our best to **minimize** collisions (MD5 and other provably-optimal hash functions), but can't **eliminate them** entirely
  * So, we tackle this complication by also developing efficient **collision-handling structures** like BSTs!
* With parallel overhead costs, however... I don't know of any easily-accessible "thing" like the theory of hash tables that can be used to optimize parallelization
  * In other words, you would think we could do a similar optimization: paralellize if benefits > costs, keep as serial otherwise
  * But, if you try to find a "framework" for this, you'll mostly find StackOverflow posts, textbooks, etc. which say "stuff varies too much between different chipsets, languages, operating systems, etc... sorry!"

## The Solution? {.crunch-title .crunch-ul}

* Again, as far as I can tell (despite workshops/courses and two summer internships just parallelizing stuff)...
* You just start trying to parallelize, carefully **measure** and **test** the performance gains/losses, and then
* Decide whether to commit to parallel or stick to serial, via an estimate of how your analysis/app will need to **scale!**
* Hence the usefulness of Prefect for visualizing tradeoff:
  * **Tasks** which used to run in serial will now run at same time, but will **take longer** (unless embarrassingly parallel) due to setup+communication overhead
