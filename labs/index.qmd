The table below collects the **pre-made** labs used in the course together in one place.

Any of the "impromptu" notebooks I make in-class, e.g. to show how something works when executed or just to respond to in-class questions, can instead be found (sorted by week) in **[this GDrive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Mgc5HX3s0nJuRGHdx64Y01_GMbT9pPMW?usp=drive_link)**
