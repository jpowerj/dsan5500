    "text": "Course Overview\nMy goal, in creating the course, is to take the general, language-agnostic data science concepts you’ve learned in (e.g.) DSAN 5000 and work through how to implement these concepts efficiently in Python, where we can define “efficient” in different ways based on different goals that we may have in different settings while working as Data Scientists.\nThe graded components for the course consist of four problem sets, an in-class midterm, and a final project. Grades will be allocated as follows:\n\n\n\nAssignment\nPercent of Final Grade\n\n\n\n\nProblem Set 1: Python Fundamentals\n8%\n\n\nProblem Set 2: Computational Complexity\n8%\n\n\nIn-Class Midterm\n34%\n\n\nProblem Set 3: Data Structures\n8%\n\n\nProblem Set 4: Algorithms\n8%\n\n\nFinal Project\n34%\n\n\n\nThe course does not have any “official” prerequisites, but a general comfort with Python is strongly recommended. If you have never used Python before, however (or if you haven’t used it in a while and feel like your skills are rusty), I will be releasing a set of preparation materials over winter break, to help make sure that everyone is on the same page coming into class in the Spring!"

Similarly, if it seems like I am spending too much time on a topic, to the point that students seem bored or impatient to move onto the next topic, we can move a topic intended for the next week to the current week!\n\n\n\nUnit\nWeek\nDate\nTopic\n\n\n\n\nUnit 1: Python Fundamentals\n1\nJan 10 (Wednesday)\nPython Fundamentals\n\n\n\n\nJan 15\nNo Class (Martin Luther King, Jr. Day)\n\n\n\n2\nJan 22\nObject-Oriented Programming (OOP)\n\n\n\n3\nJan 29\nOOP in Data Science\n\n\nUnit 2: Computational Complexity\n4\nFeb 5\nComputational Complexity Basics\n\n\n\n5\nFeb 12\nComplexity of Common Data Science Operations\n\n\nUnit 3: Data Structures\n6\nFeb 19\nSequences, Sets, and Maps\n\n\n\n7\nFeb 26\nHeaps and Stacks\n\n\n\n\nMar 4\nNo Class (Spring Break)\n\n\n\n8\nMar 11\nTrees and Graphs\n\n\nUnit 4: Algorithms\n9\nMar 18\nSearch Trees\n\n\n\n10\nMar 25\nSorting Algorithms\n\n\n\n\nApr 1\nNo Class (Easter Break)\n\n\n\n11\nApr 8\nGraph Algorithms\n\n\nUnit 5: Advanced Topics and Applications\n12\nApr 15\nGeographic Informatin Systems (GIS)\n\n\n\n13\nApr 22\nApplications in Bioinformatics\n\n\n\n14\nApr 29\nApplications in NLP"
