Grades will be allocated as follows:\n\n\n\nCategory\nPercent of Final Grade\n\n\n\n\nIn-Class Midterm\n25%\n\n\nFinal Project\n30%\n\n\nHomeworks\n45%\n\n\nHW1: Python Fundamentals\n9%\n\n\nHW2: Object-Oriented Programming\n9%\n\n\nHW3: Data Structures, Algorithms, and Complexity\n9%\n\n\nHW4: Data-Processing Pipelines\n9%\n\n\nHW5: Parallel Pipelines and Map-Reduce\n9%\n\n\n\nThe course does not have any “official” prerequisites, but a general comfort with Python is strongly recommended.

Similarly, if it seems like I am spending too much time on a topic, to the point that students seem bored or impatient to move onto the next topic, we can move a topic intended for the next week to the current week!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnit\nWeek\nDate\nTopic\n\n\n\n\nUnit 1: Python Fundamentals\n1\nJan 8\nCourse Intro and Motivation\n\n\n\n2\nJan 15\nSoftware Design Patterns and Object-Oriented Programming\n\n\nUnit 2: Object-Oriented Programming\n3\nJan 22\nData Structures and Computational Complexity\n\n\n\n\nJan 27 (Monday), 11:59pm EST\nHW1 (Python Fundamentals) Due\n\n\n\n4\nJan 29\nData Structures from Scratch with OOP\n\n\nUnit 3: Data Structures, Algorithms, and Complexity\n5\nFeb 5\nBinary Search Trees\n\n\n\n\nFeb 7 (Friday), 5:59pm EST\nHW2 (Object-Oriented Programming) Due\n\n\n\n6\nFeb 12\nDepth-First and Breadth-First Search\n\n\n\n7\nFeb 19\nCode Examples and Midterm Prep\n\n\n\n\nFeb 21 (Friday), 5:59pm EST\nHW3 (Data Structures, Algorithms, and Complexity) Due\n\n\nMidterm\n8\nFeb 26\nIn-Class Midterm\n\n\n\n\nMar 6\nNo Class (Spring Break)\n\n\nUnit 4: Data-Processing Pipelines\n9\nMar 12\nETL Pipelines with Prefect\n\n\n\n10\nMar 19\nData Pipeline Orchestration\n\n\n\n\nApr 11 (Wednesday), 11:59pm EDT\nHW4 (Data-Processing Pipelines) Due\n\n\n\n11\nMar 26\nFrom Serial to Parallel Pipelines\n\n\n\n12\nApr 9\nFinal Projects, Map-Reduce\n\n\nUnit 5: Final Project Application Areas\n13\nApr 16\n(6:30-7:30pm) Applications: Bioinformatics\n(7:30-9pm) Final Project office hours (Jeff and Renee)\n\n\n\n14\nApr 23\n(6:30-7:30pm) Applications: NLP\n(7:30-9pm) Final Project office hours (Jeff, Renee, Jiatong)\n\n\n\n\nApr 25 (Friday), 5:59pm EDT\nHW5 (Parallel Pipelines and Map-Reduce) Due\n\n\n\n\nMay 3 (Friday), 11:59pm EST\nFinal Project Due",

Specifically, late penalties will be applied based on the following scale (unless you obtain an excused lateness from one of the instructional staff!):\n\n0 to 24 hours after due date: no penalty\n24 to 30 hours after due date: 2.5% penalty\n30 to 42 hours after due date: 5% penalty\n42 to 54 hours after due date: 10% penalty\n54 to 66 hours after due date: 20% penalty\nMore than 66 hours after due date: Assignment submissions no longer accepted (without instructor approval)\n\nExcused lateness exceptions will be grounded in a policy where you can “pause” the class (due-date-wise, but also just, expectation-of-progress-wise more generally) to take the time you need to handle things happening in your life. Then, you can “resume” work once you feel more centered/once you find yourself back on stable ground. The “Maslow’s hierarchy” model from psychology (Figure 1) provides a straightforward way to think about this approach.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs, from Wikimedia\n\n\n\nLearning data ethics is way up there in the blue triangle, so, it’s important that you feel like the first four levels are solidified before you turn your focus back to classwork. And, it’s a win-win, because it means that once you’re back in action you can be more engaged and receptive to new topics, rather than being forced to “simulate” being in the blue triangle while in reality struggling in other spots!",

This means that, for all of the topics we’ve covered thus far, there’s a next step that could be taken in learning about the topic. In general this could mean one of the following four options, where I’ve provided a concrete example specific to the class under each heading:\n\n  \n    Option 1: A Deeper Dive\n  \n  \n    \n    \n    \n          Example 1.1: Efficient implementations of deletion in linked lists, rather than just the insertion and retrieval operations on linked lists that we looked at.\n          Example 1.2: Expanding the Binary Search Tree into a Quadtree\n          Example 1.3: Creating an interactive visualization (using Streamlit, for example) of a data structure or algorithm.\n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n    Option 2: Fixing an Issue\n  \n  \n    \n    \n    \n      Example 2.1: Binary Search Trees lose their logarithmic efficiency if items are added to them in order (since newly-added items are always added to the right subtree of all existing items, thus \"degenerating\" into a linear linked list structure), an issue which fancier versions of the BST like AVL Trees and Red-Black Trees resolve.\n      Example 2.2: As you saw in the Midterm, hash tables \"degenerate\" from (approximate) \\( O(1) \\) efficiency to \\( O(\\log_2(n)) \\) efficiency if the hashing function we use is not efficient or not collision-resistant. So, your project could be to explore and summarize how efficient and collision-resistant hash functions work, and then implement one such hash function in Python.\n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n    Option 3: Exploring Applications\n  \n  \n    \n    \n    \n      Example 3.1: In bioinformatics, the sorting algorithms we did learn are helpful for genetic sequence searching, but can be made even more efficient for genetic sequence searches by applying the Burrows-Wheeler Transform to a collection of genetic sequences before applying the sorting algorithms.\n      Example 3.2: We learned Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) in somewhat of a hurry, as a way to traverse over the nodes in a Binary Search Tree, but they both have many more exciting applications! For example, if you're interested in web scraping, you could adapt the code from HW2 to create a polymorphic web-scraper, where each node is a webpage, and processing a node means adding each link in the page to the stack/queue.\n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n    Option 4: Proving Correctness and/or Efficiency\n  \n  \n    \n    \n    \n      Example 4.1: In the lecture on Insertion-Sort, I hinted at the notion of a correctness proof using invariants---how it would proceed along the same lines as a proof by induction that you might have seen in a previous math class---but never formally walked you through how to do one.\n      Example 4.2: Over the first half of the course, we were able to gradually improve retrieval of elements from data structures in a progression like:\n      \n      \n\n\n\nLinear\n\nLogarithmic\n\nConstant\n\n\n\n\nLinkedList\\(O(n)\\)\n\\(\\rightarrow\\)\nBST\\(O(\\log_2(n))\\)\n\\(\\rightarrow\\)\nHashTable\\(O(1 + \\varepsilon)\\)\n\n\n\n\n      \n      But then, for search, something was missing 🧐:\n\n      \n\n\n\nLinear\n\nLogarithmic\n\nConstant\n\n\n\n\nInsertion-Sort\\(O(n^2)\\)\n\\(\\rightarrow\\)\nMerge-Sort\\(O(n\\log_2(n))\\)\n\\(\\rightarrow\\)\n???\n\n\n\n\n\n  Prove that it's in fact not possible to make that additional \"jump\" to constant-time search in \\(O(n)\\), except in very special cases.\n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n    Option 5: Building an ETL Pipeline\n  \n  \n    \n    \n    \n      Example 5.1: If there is some task you currently handle manually---say, entering receipts from your email into a spreadsheet, or (the example I mentioned in class) making a fulltext index of ebooks in your library---your project can explore automating this task using Pydantic and Prefect\n      Example 5.2: If there are particular APIs and Database solutions that you've been hoping to explore, now's your chance! Create an ETL pipeline which Extracts data from the API, Transforms it in some interesting way, then Loads it into (for example) an SQL or MongoDB database.\n    \n\n    (For this option, note that we used Pydantic in the course because of its OOP orientation, but if your task is more DataFrame-heavy, you can use Pandera for DataFrame validation in place of Pydantic! Feel free to schedule an office hour with Jeff for more on Pandera)\n    \n  \n\nSo, your task for the final project will be to\n\nChoose one of the topics we covered\nDetermine or work with your mentor to find an interesting “next step” with respect to this topic\nCarry out this next step (details below, since this will look different for different choices from the above options!)\nWrite up what you did in a report, including any of the code or math or data analysis that you did in Step 3",

For example, if you're interested in web scraping, you could adapt the code from HW2 to create a polymorphic web-scraper, where each node is a webpage, and processing a node means adding each link in the page to the stack/queue.\n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n    Option 4: Proving Correctness and/or Efficiency\n  \n  \n    \n    \n    \n      Example 4.1: In the lecture on Insertion-Sort, I hinted at the notion of a correctness proof using invariants---how it would proceed along the same lines as a proof by induction that you might have seen in a previous math class---but never formally walked you through how to do one.\n      Example 4.2: Over the first half of the course, we were able to gradually improve retrieval of elements from data structures in a progression like:\n      \n      \n\n\n\nLinear\n\nLogarithmic\n\nConstant\n\n\n\n\nLinkedList\\(O(n)\\)\n\\(\\rightarrow\\)\nBST\\(O(\\log_2(n))\\)\n\\(\\rightarrow\\)\nHashTable\\(O(1 + \\varepsilon)\\)\n\n\n\n\n      \n      But then, for search, something was missing 🧐:\n\n      \n\n\n\nLinear\n\nLogarithmic\n\nConstant\n\n\n\n\nInsertion-Sort\\(O(n^2)\\)\n\\(\\rightarrow\\)\nMerge-Sort\\(O(n\\log_2(n))\\)\n\\(\\rightarrow\\)\n???\n\n\n\n\n\n  Prove that it's in fact not possible to make that additional \"jump\" to constant-time search in \\(O(n)\\), except in very special cases.\n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n    Option 5: Building an ETL Pipeline\n  \n  \n    \n    \n    \n      Example 5.1: If there is some task you currently handle manually---say, entering receipts from your email into a spreadsheet, or (the example I mentioned in class) making a fulltext index of ebooks in your library---your project can explore automating this task using Pydantic and Prefect\n      Example 5.2: If there are particular APIs and Database solutions that you've been hoping to explore, now's your chance! Create an ETL pipeline which Extracts data from the API, Transforms it in some interesting way, then Loads it into (for example) an SQL or MongoDB database.\n    \n\n    (For this option, note that we used Pydantic in the course because of its OOP orientation, but if your task is more DataFrame-heavy, you can use Pandera for DataFrame validation in place of Pydantic! Feel free to schedule an office hour with Jeff for more on Pandera)\n    \n  \n\nSo, your task for the final project will be to\n\nChoose one of the topics we covered\nDetermine or work with your mentor to find an interesting “next step” with respect to this topic\nCarry out this next step (details below, since this will look different for different choices from the above options!)\nWrite up what you did in a report, including any of the code or math or data analysis that you did in Step 3",

Therefore, for a Quarto document or Jupyter notebook, the length can be the equivalent of this (for example, you can print-preview the Quarto doc to see how many pages it would produce if printed)\nIt should have an abstract, a 250-500 word paragraph at the very top of the manuscript, summarizing what you did\nCitations, if used, should be set up so that they’re handled automatically.

Define \\(T(n)\\) on \\(n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\) by\n\\[\nT(n) = aT(n/b) + f(n)\n\\]\nwhere \\(aT(n/b) = a'T(\\lfloor n/b \\rfloor) + a''T(\\lceil n/b \\rceil)\\) for some \\(a' \\geq 0\\) and \\(a'' \\geq 0\\) satisfying \\(a = a' + a''\\). Then the asymptotic behavior of \\(T(n)\\) can be characterized as follows:\n\nIf there exists \\(\\epsilon &gt; 0\\) such that \\(f(n) = O(n^{\\log_b(a) - \\epsilon})\\), then \\(T(n) = \\Theta(n^{\\log_b(a)})\\)\nIf there exists \\(k \\geq 0\\) such that \\(f(n) = \\Theta(n^{\\log_b(a)}\\log_2^k(n))\\), then \\(T(n) = \\Theta(n^{\\log_b(a)}\\log_2^{k+1}(n))\\).\nIf there exists \\(\\epsilon &gt; 0\\) such that \\(f(n) = \\Omega(n^{\\log_b(a) + \\epsilon})\\), and if \\(f(n)\\) satisfies the regularity condition \\(af(n/b) \\leq cf(n)\\) for some constant \\(c &lt; 1\\) and all sufficiently large \\(n\\), then \\(T(n) = \\Theta(f(n))\\).\n\n\nProof.

    "section": "Two Ways of Running Code",
    "text": "Two Ways of Running Code\nUp until this unit with Prefect and pipeline orchestration libraries, you really only had one way of writing and executing code:\n\nWrite the code in a cell of an .ipynb notebook, then\nClick the Run button (or Cmd+EnterCmd+Enter), and see what happens\n\n(This is related to clicking the Render/Preview button, since you can think of that as a shortcut for running all the cells and combining the results into an HTML document)\nIn the first few questions, where we just ask you to write flows (consisting of a series of tasks), the code still runs in this way, so it seems like not much has changed, and that Prefect is just a fancy wrapper around the way you’ve run code before…\nWhen you create a Prefect deployment, though (which is different from a flow, in an important way), the process is different, and it’s going to feel less intuitive at first because you won’t instantly see the results from running your code when you click the run button! Now the process of running your code will instead look like:\n\nWrite the code in a cell of an .ipynb, where instead of calling the flow function in the normal way (like my_flow()), you instead use Prefect’s special .serve() function (like my_flow.serve())\nSave the code to a .py file using the %%writefile &lt;filename&gt;.py cell magic\nRun the saved .py file from a different code cell, using the %run &lt;filename&gt;.py cell magic, which:\n\nRegisters (or, “posts”) the deployment on Prefect Cloud, as a piece of code that you’d like to allow it to manage, and then\nServes the flow as an ongoing process, meaning that it actually just sits and waits to be run externally!\n\nBecause of the way Step 3 works, now to actually execute the flow, you need to go into the Prefect UI and trigger the run of the code somehow: one way is to just click the “Run” -&gt; “Quick run” button in the upper-right of the Prefect UI page for the Deployment, and another is to use “Run” -&gt; “Custom run”:\n\n\n\n\n\nAn advantage to using “Custom run” is that you’ll be able to update the parameters to your flow before running it.\nThen, at the end of HW3, you encountered a third way that the code can be run, that is, using a schedule. In the Prefect UI, if the schedule that you passed as an argument to .serve() was parsed correctly, you should see the schedule details in a panel directly underneath the run button1:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\nIn a non-Prefect setting, your code lives in a notebook cell, waiting to be run. When you run the cell, the code is sent to the Python interpreter, and any outputs produced when it is interpreted are displayed underneath the code cell.\nIn a Prefect setting, your code still lives in a notebook cell, but now when you run the cell (or, in our case, when you run the .py file generated as a copy of the cell) it establishes a connection to Prefect Cloud, allowing the code to be triggered externally:\n\nBy clicking the “Run” button in Prefect’s UI,\nOn the basis of a schedule, or\nWhenever some event occurs"

    "section": "The Power of Event Triggers",
    "text": "The Power of Event Triggers\nThe last bullet point in the above summary, of running code whenever a given event occurs, is extremely powerful! I’m sad that it’s the one of those three options that we didn’t get to cover in HW3, but as an example you can think of the Dropbox auto-book-scanner pipeline I showed briefly in class. This pipeline works like:\n\nUpdates to a Dropbox folder (files added, deleted, or modified) are trigger a webhook established from within Prefect’s UI\nThis Prefect webhook is then set as the event trigger which runs the flow code.\nThe Extract step of the flow code loads the files added to the Dropbox folder into Python’s memory\nThe Transform step of the flow code runs these files through OCR software, turning PDFs into plaintext that NLP algorithms can work with\nThe Load step of the flow code then adds the extracted plaintext into a MongoDB collection.\n\nSo, hopefully that example can “click” in your head why the data-processing pipeline setup is so powerful: rather than having to sit there and physically click run on your code to have it carry out some data science procedure, you can instead just write the code then tell Prefect to run it whenever something changes that would require re-running the procedure.\nFor example, if you happened to be the data scientist for a public opinion firm like Pew or Gallup, the non-Prefect way you might operate would be something like:\n\nOne of the poll managers adds new poll data as a into a Dropbox folder as a .csv file\nThe poll manager then sends you an email like “Hey, new poll results are available, can you analyze them for me?”\nWhen you check this email (days later), you download the .csv file onto your computer, and use it as input to some code you’ve written that generates plots at the end, summarizing the results\nYou reply to the poll manager’s email, saying “Hey, here are the plots summarizing the results (attached)”\nUpon checking this email (yet more days later), the poll manager gives a thumbs-up, or they ask you to re-do the analysis using a different set of data…\n\nNow, I hope you can see how literally this entire chain of events can be automated using Prefect! You can:\n\nTake your analysis and plot-generation function and add @flow to the top of it,\nSet it to run on the trigger “Dropbox folder modified”,\nSet it to place the plots into an Artifact (like we placed the wordcloud into our artifact in HW3), and\nHave this artifact auto-emailed to the poll manager upon completion (using the Automation tool within Prefect’s UI)\n\nWe didn’t get to see how the notifications work either (it would have been even messier to grade, unfortunately), but as a preview of how that works, here are the super-basic settings I have for an Automation I made to send me a text message (through Prefect’s built-in Twilio block) when certain important GitHub repos are pushed to:"
