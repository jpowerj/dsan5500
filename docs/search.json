The course will also cover objects and classes in Python, as well as building new structures and objects. The class will cover algorithms including runtime, recurrence, and development. Applications will include data science problems. Prerequisite: A working or intermediate knowledge of Python. 3 credits."

The course takes place on Mondays from 12:30-3:00pm in Car Barn room 204.\nMore details are provided on the syllabus, but as an overview, the only graded materials for the course will be:\n\nFour problem sets, evenly spaced throughout the semester,\nOne in-class midterm exam, and\nOne final project, due at the end of the semester (instead of a final exam)\n\nThe course does not have any “official” prerequisites, but a general comfort with Python is strongly recommended. If you have never used Python before, however (or if you haven’t used it in a while and feel like your skills are rusty), I will be releasing a set of preparation materials over winter break, to help make sure that everyone is on the same page coming into class in the Spring!\nCourse Description:\nThe Data Structures, Objects, and Algorithms in Python course will look at built-in data structures, such as dictionaries, lists, tuples, sets, strings, and frozen sets.
