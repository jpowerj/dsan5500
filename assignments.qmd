Assignments will be **manually graded**, and these grades will be entered on both Canvas and Google Classroom. To **submit** each assignment, all you need to do is **save** your Colab notebook: when the late-submission period for each assignment ends, we will take your most-recently-updated notebook files and grade these as your submission. See the next section for Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) about the **hint reports** you can automatically request for each assignment (besides the Midterm), or see the [Points Per Question](#points-per-question) section below for a summary of the number of total points each question on each assignment is worth.

## Autohinter Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

      <button class="accordion-button" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#collapseOne" aria-expanded="true" aria-controls="collapseOne">
        Are the results in the autohinter report the same my grade on an assignment?

        <p>The <b>autohinter report</b> is there for the sake of <i>learning</i>: the goal is to enable you to <i>try</i> different approaches to solving a problem, then receive <i>instant feedback</i> on whether your approach has brought you closer-to or further-from the solution.</p>
        <p>Your ultimate <b>recorded grade</b> for an assignment is based on <b>human, manual grading</b> of the assignment, so that we can take into account things like:
        <ul>
          <li>Alternative ways to arrive at the solution that we (as instructors) did not foresee when making the autohinting code for that question</li>
          <li>Contextual details that you can <b>write into</b> your responses (using Colab's "Add Comment" feature on the response cell), to clarify why you chose one response over another and/or why you are confused about something in the autohinter report</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

  <div class="accordion-item">
    <div class="accordion-header" id="headingTwo">
      <button class="accordion-button collapsed" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#collapseTwo" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseTwo">
        Why am I seeing a "500: Internal Server Error" message when I request an autohinter report?
      </button>
    </div>
    <div id="collapseTwo" class="accordion-collapse collapse" aria-labelledby="headingTwo" data-bs-parent="#accordionExample">
      <div class="accordion-body">
        <p>This error could have many causes, since it just means that "something has occurred within the server code that led to a crash".</p>
        <p>However, one of the most common reasons for this, and the simplest to fix, is that <strong>the autohinter code "detects" your response cells</strong> for a given question like (say) Q3.2 by <strong>finding a code cell with <code># @title Q3.2-response</code> as its first line</strong>. Although these are the default first lines in each code cell when the Colab notebooks are distributed, you may have inadvertently changed the first line in a given response cell while working on the assignment.</p>
        <p>An easy way to detect and fix where this might be happening in your code is to open the <strong>Table of Contents</strong> view on the left side of the Colab interface: any code cells that start with <code># @title</code> will be "registered" in Colab's Table of Contents, so that in this Table of Contents listing you should see e.g. Question 1.1 followed by an indented "Q1.1-response", Question 1.2 followed by an indented "Q1.2-response" listing, and so on. If one of these "QX.X-response" entries is missing (for example, if the Table of Contents skips directly from "Question 1.1" to "Question 1.2"), find the relevant code cell and then re-add <code># @title Q1.1-response</code> as its first line.</p>

        <p>Here, the first thing to check is the **URL** of the server that the submission cell is using: Previous versions of the class used a National Science Foundation "Jetstream" server, but this semester we are using a (...personally funded) Google Cloud Run setup.</p>
        <p>So, this just means:
          <ul>
          <li>If you see the older URL, <code>http://jag.soc240036.projects.jetstream-cloud.org:5000/submit</code>,</li>
          <li>Replace it with the new Google Cloud Run URL, <code>https://jah-submit-83645199100.us-east4.run.app/</code></li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>If you replace the URL and now get a 500 error, see the above entry. If you replace the URL and <i>still</i> get a 404 error, this means that the server is fully <strong>down</strong>, meaning that this error is happening <i>before</i> your notebook is even able to reach the server. In this case, the problem is most likely something like a server crash rather than any issue within your notebook, so please contact Jeff at <a href='mailto:jj1088@georgetown.edu' target='_blank'><code>jj1088@georgetown.edu</code></a> if you encounter this 404 error.</p>

## Points Per Question

Use the **tabs below** to view the point distributions for different assignments.

The distributions are imported from Google Sheets mainly for transparency: so that you can see exactly how totals are computed as a sum of the individual points allocated for each test!

```{r}
#| label: points-table-fn
#| warning: false
#| echo: false
library(tidyverse)
gen_points_table <- function(hw_url) {
  hw_df <- read_csv(hw_url, col_types="cccdc")
  # print(hw_df)
  hw_df <- hw_df |> drop_na(points)
  hw_df$points <- as.character(hw_df$points)
  hw_df$part_total <- as.character(hw_df$part_total)
  hw_df <- hw_df |> mutate(
    part = replace_na(part, ""),
    part_total = replace_na(part_total, ""),
    qid = replace_na(qid, ""),
    # test_type = replace_na(test_type, "")
  )
  return(hw_df)
}
```
