  abstract = {This title covers a broad range of algorithms in depth, yet makes their design and analysis accessible to all levels of readers. Each chapter is relatively self-contained and can be used as a unit of study. The algorithms are described in English and in a pseudocode designed to be readable by anyone who has done a little programming. The explanations have been kept elementary without sacrificing depth of coverage or mathematical rigor.},

  abstract = {Based on the authors' market leading data structures books in Java and C++, this textbook offers a comprehensive, definitive introduction to data structures in Python by authoritative authors.  Data Structures and Algorithms in Python is the first authoritative object-oriented book available for the Python data structures course.  Designed to provide a comprehensive introduction to data structures and algorithms, including their design, analysis, and implementation, the text will maintain the same general structure as Data Structures and Algorithms in Java and Data Structures and Algorithms in C++.},

  author = {Lee, Kent D. and Hubbard, Steve},
  year = {2015},
  month = jan,
  publisher = {Springer},
  abstract = {This clearly structured and easy to read textbook explains the concepts and techniques required to write programs that can handle large amounts of data efficiently.Project-oriented and classroom-tested, the book presents a number of important algorithms supported by motivating examples that bring meaning to the problems faced by computer programmers. The idea of computational complexity is also introduced, demonstrating what can and cannot be computed efficiently so that the programmer can make informed judgements about the algorithms they use. The text assumes some basic experience in computer programming and familiarity in an object-oriented language, but not necessarily with Python.Topics and features: includes both introductory and advanced data structures and algorithms topics, with suggested chapter sequences for those respective courses provided in the preface; provides learning goals, review questions and programming exercises in each chapter, as well as numerous illustrative examples; offers downloadable programs and supplementary files at an associated website, with instructor materials available from the author; presents a primer on Python for those coming from a different language background; reviews the use of hashing in sets and maps, along with an examination of binary search trees and tree traversals, and material on depth first search of graphs; discusses topics suitable for an advanced course, such as membership structures, heaps, balanced binary search trees, B-trees and heuristic search.Students of computer science will find this clear and concise textbook to be invaluable for undergraduate courses on data structures and algorithms, at both introductory and advanced levels. The book is also suitable as a refresher guide for computer programmers starting new jobs working with Python.},

  publisher = {Cambridge University Press},
  abstract = {Written by leading authorities in database and Web technologies, this book is essential reading for students and practitioners alike. The popularity of the Web and Internet commerce provides many extremely large datasets from which information can be gleaned by data mining. This book focuses on practical algorithms that have been used to solve key problems in data mining and can be applied successfully to even the largest datasets. It begins with a discussion of the map-reduce framework, an important tool for parallelizing algorithms automatically. The authors explain the tricks of locality-sensitive hashing and stream processing algorithms for mining data that arrives too fast for exhaustive processing. Other chapters cover the PageRank idea and related tricks for organizing the Web, the problems of finding frequent itemsets and clustering. This second edition includes new and extended coverage on social networks, machine learning and dimensionality reduction.},

  abstract = {This text focuses on finite problems and emphasizes concrete models of machines and programming styles. Using problems defined over infinite domains and abstract machine models as models, emphasis is given to concrete problems of the kind found in algorithms textbooks, as well as machine models related to current technology. The book integrates the theme of parallelism throughout the book (for example, circuits are presented as parallel machines) and studies the exchanges between space, time and other resources on a variety of machine models.},
